# QuestionAnsweringSystem
A simple question-answering system built in Google Colab using PyTorch and RNN. Trained on a small custom dataset of QA pairs, this model demonstrates how basic NLP with deep learning can be used for intelligent response generation. Easily extendable to larger datasets for more powerful performance.
